            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Sushmita Singh. I’m currently a 2nd-year student at KCC Institute of Technology and Management,
                where I am pursuing a Bachelor's of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization
                in Artificial Intelligence. My journey in the tech field is driven by a deep passion for understanding
                and leveraging technology to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                My educational background began at Evergreen Public School, where I developed a strong foundation in a
                wide range of subjects. The rigorous academic environment there fostered a love for learning and
                curiosity that has continued to guide my studies and career aspirations.
            </p>
            <p>
                At KCC Institute, I am immersing myself in various aspects of technology, from the fundamentals of
                computer science to the cutting-edge developments in artificial intelligence. My coursework and projects
                are designed to challenge and expand my knowledge, providing me with practical skills that I am eager to
                apply in real-world scenarios.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my studies, I am enthusiastic about exploring opportunities that allow me to contribute
                to the tech industry. I am particularly interested in how technology can be used to address pressing
                issues and drive progress. Whether it's through developing new software, enhancing user experiences, or
                tackling complex engineering challenges, I am committed to making a meaningful impact.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I continue my academic and professional journey, I am excited about the future and the potential to
                contribute to advancements in technology. I look forward to the challenges and opportunities ahead and
                am dedicated to achieving excellence in my field.

            <p>
                In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I have a variety of hobbies that bring joy and
                balance to my life:
            </p>
            <ul>

                    Writing Poems: I have a deep passion for poetry and enjoy expressing my thoughts and emotions
                    through creative writing. Crafting poems allows me to explore different perspectives and capture
                    moments uniquely and artistically.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dancing: Dancing is another one of my favorite activities. It’s a wonderful way for me to unwind and
                    express myself physically. Whether it's learning new dance styles or simply enjoying music, dancing
                    is a source of great joy and energy in my life.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Astronomy: I’m fascinated by astronomy and the mysteries of the universe. Exploring the stars and
                    learning about celestial events and phenomena sparks my curiosity and inspires wonder about the
                    vastness of space.
